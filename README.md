# Weather Prediction

#### In this project on weather prediction, we have employed a range of algorithms including Random Forest Regression, Decision Tree Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, Support Vector Regression, and Gradient Boosting algorithm. Through rigorous analysis, we have determined that the Random Forest algorithm outperforms the others in terms of accuracy and reliability. Additionally, our ensemble model, which combines the strengths of multiple algorithms, has also shown promising results. By leveraging these advanced techniques, we aim to provide accurate temperature predictions by considering various factors that influence weather patterns.
